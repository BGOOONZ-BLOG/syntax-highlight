This post highlights the most common and convenient ones.</p>\n<p>Official packages for all the major platforms are available at <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a>.</p>\n<p>One very convenient way to install Node.js is through a package manager. In this case, every operating system has its own.</p>\n<p>On macOS, <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> is the de-facto standard, and - once installed - allows you to install Node.js very easily, by running this command in the CLI:</p>\n\n          <div class=\"gatsby-remark-prismjs-copy-button-container\">\n            <div class=\"gatsby-remark-prismjs-copy-button\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" aria-pressed=\"false\" onclick=\"gatsbyRemarkCopyToClipboard(this, this.parentNode.nextElementSibling)\">\n              Copy\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">brew install node</code></pre></div>\n<p>Other package managers for Linux and Windows are listed in <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/\">https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/</a></p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">nvm</code> is a popular way to run Node.js. It allows you to easily switch the Node.js version, and install new versions to try and easily rollback if something breaks, for example.</p>\n<p>It is also very useful to test your code with old Node.js versions.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/creationix/nvm\">https://github.com/creationix/nvm</a> for more information about this option.</p>\n<p>My suggestion is to use the official installer if you are just starting out and you don't use Homebrew already, otherwise, Homebrew is my favorite solution.</p>\n<p>In any case, when Node.js is installed you'll have access to the <code class=\"language-text\">node</code> executable program in the command line.</p>"}
